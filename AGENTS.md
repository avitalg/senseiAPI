# SenseiAPI — Agent Guide

Instructions for AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.). Follow these on every change.
Cursor users: the same rules live in `.cursor/rules/` and apply automatically.

## Project
- FastAPI service (Python 3.11+). Entry point: `main.py`.
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt`; dev/test tools in `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Transcription has two interchangeable backends behind the `Transcriber` ABC, picked by
  `TRANSCRIBER_BACKEND`: `elevenlabs` (default, hosted, needs `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) and
  `whisper` (local `faster-whisper`). Both must return the same `Transcript` shape.
  Never let tests hit the real ElevenLabs API — inject a fake client.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Run & Verify
- Run the API: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Before declaring any task done, ALL of these must pass:
  - `ruff check .`
  - `ruff format --check .`
  - `mypy .`
  - `pytest`

## Coding Standards (must follow)
- **Types everywhere.** Full type hints on all functions; no bare `Any` without a reason.
- **Thin handlers.** Route handlers validate input and delegate to services/functions; keep business logic out of the handler.
- **Pydantic at the boundary.** Validate all external input; use explicit request/response models and `response_model=`. Never return secrets or raw ORM objects.
- **Explicit errors.** Catch the narrowest exception, add context, re-raise with `from`. Never `except: pass`. Use `logging`, never `print`. Never log secrets/PII.
- **Config from env.** No hardcoded secrets, URLs, or keys. Keep `.env` out of git.
- **Async-safe.** Use `async def` handlers; never block the event loop with sync I/O.

## Testing (required, not optional)
- Every behavior change ships with `pytest` tests in `tests/` (`test_*.py`).
- Test endpoints via `TestClient`/`httpx.AsyncClient`; assert status code AND body.
- Cover happy path, edge case, and failure path. Use fixtures and `parametrize`.
- Tests must be deterministic and isolated — mock external services, no real network.
- Fixing a bug? Add a failing test that reproduces it first, then fix.
- Never weaken or delete a test just to make the suite green.

## Don'ts
- Don't commit generated artifacts, `.venv`, `.env`, or secrets.
- Don't introduce dependencies without adding them to the requirements files.
- Don't disable lint/type/test checks to "make it pass."
